                Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[7]Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.
                Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing.</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Information technology (IT) is a set of related fields that encompass computer systems, software,
                     programming languages and data and information processing and storage.[1] IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).
                     [2] An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking.
                     a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, and an IT project 
                     usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system.[3] Looking at early computing, Alan Turing, J. Presper Eckert, 
                     and John Mauchly were considered some of the major pioneers of computer technology in the mid-1900s. Giving them such credit for their developments,
                     most of their efforts were focused on designing the first digital computer. Along with that, topics such as artificial intelligence began to be brought
                     up as Turing was beginning to question such technology of the time period.[9]

                    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals.
                        It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.
                        AI technology is widely used throughout industry,of the government and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search),
                        recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as on the  Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools 
                        (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).           
                        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.The field went through multiple cycles of followed by disappointment and loss of funding,
                        but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,there was a vast increase in funding and interest.                        
                        The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The difrent traditional goals of AI research include reasoning.
                        knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.
                        To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics.
                        operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.
